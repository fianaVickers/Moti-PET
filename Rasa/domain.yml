  utter_breathing_info: 
  - text: "Deep breathing, also known as diaphragmatic breathing or abdominal breathing, is a technique that involves taking slow, deep breaths from the diaphragm, rather than shallow breaths from the chest.

  utter_meditation_stepOne: 
  - text: "Choose a quiet place where you can sit or lie down comfortably without being disturbed. You can sit cross-legged on the floor, in a chair with your feet flat on the ground, or lie down if that is more comfortable for you. Place your hands gently in your lap or on your knees, palms facing upward or downward. Close your eyes to block out distractions and bring your attention inward."

  utter_meditation_stepTwo: 
  - text: "Begin by taking a few deep breaths. Inhale deeply through your nose, filling your lungs completely. Hold for a moment, and then exhale slowly and fully through your mouth. With each exhale, feel your body begin to relax. Release any tension in your shoulders, neck, and jaw. Allow your body to sink into a natural and comfortable posture."

  utter_meditation_stepThree: 
  - text: "Now, bring your full attention to your breath. Breathe naturally, in and out through your nose. Notice the sensation of the air as it enters your nostrils, fills your lungs, and then leaves your body. Pay attention to how your chest and abdomen gently rise and fall with each breath. If your mind starts to wander (which is completely normal), gently bring your focus back to your breath without judgment."

  utter_meditation_stepFour: 
  - text: "As you continue to focus on your breath, notice if any thoughts arise. Instead of engaging with the thoughts, simply observe them. Imagine your thoughts as clouds passing in the skyâ€”acknowledge them and let them drift away, returning your attention to your breath each time. You do not need to force your mind to be completely empty. Just notice the thoughts and let them go without attachment."

  utter_meditation_stepFive: 
  - text: "Allow yourself to simply be in the present moment. Feel the stillness around you, the calmness in your body, and the rhythm of your breathing. You can silently repeat a simple phrase or affirmation, such as I am calm and at peace or I am here, in this moment with each inhale and exhale. Feel yourself grounded in the present, without worrying about the past or the future. Just experience being fully alive and aware right now."

  utter_meditation_stepSix: 
  - text: "When you feel ready to end your meditation, take a few deeper breaths. Gently bring your awareness back to the room around you. Notice the sounds, sensations, and the feeling of your body touching the ground or chair. Slowly begin to move your fingers and toes, stretch your arms, and open your eyes when you're ready."

  utter_meditation_stepSeven: 
  - text: "Before getting up, take a moment to notice how you feel after the meditation. You may feel more relaxed, centered, or clear-headed. Acknowledge any positive changes, no matter how small, and carry this sense of calm into your day."

  utter_meditation_info: 
  - text: "Meditation is a mental practice that involves focusing the mind and eliminating distractions to achieve a state of clarity, calmness, and heightened awareness. Itâ€™s often used to cultivate mindfulness, improve emotional regulation, reduce stress, and enhance overall well-being.
